## Library of Babel (work in progress)
# Welcome to my Library of Babel. This library contains every possible book that has ever existed, and will ever exist. It contains every possible combination of 400 page books using the 26 letters of the English alphabet, and select punctuation. It contains patent, every invention, every idea, ever literary classic, every news story, every outcome of every major sporting event in the past, and for all eternity. Enter at your own risk. Many a person has been driven insane by their eternal, futile quest for knowledge within these endless walls.
